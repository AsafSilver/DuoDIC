abstract = {Three-dimensional Digital Image Correlation (3D-DIC) is a non-contact optical-numerical technique for evaluating the dynamic mechanical behavior at the surface of structures and materials, including biological tissues. 3D-DIC can be used to extract shape and full-field displacements and strains with high resolution, at various length scales. While various commercial and academic 3D-DIC software exist, the field lacks 3D-DIC packages which offer straightforward calibration and data-merging solutions for multi-view analysis, which is particularly desirable in biomedical applications. To address these limitations, we present MultiDIC, an open-source MATLAB toolbox, featuring the first 3D-DIC software specifically dedicated to multi-view setups. MultiDIC integrates robust two-dimensional subset-based DIC software with specially tailored calibration procedures, to reconstruct the dynamic behavior of surfaces from multiple stereo-pairs. MultiDIC contains novel algorithms to automatically merge meshes from multiple stereo-pairs, and to compute and visualize 3D shape and full-field motion, deformation, and strain. User interfaces provide capabilities to perform 3D-DIC analyses without interacting with MATLAB syntax, while stand-alone functions also allow proficient MATLAB users to write custom scripts for specific experimental requirements. This paper discusses the challenges underlying multi-view 3D-DIC, details the proposed solutions, and describes the algorithms implemented in MultiDIC. The performance of MultiDIC is tested using a low-cost experimental system featuring a 360Â° 12-camera setup. The software and system are evaluated using measurement of a cylindrical object with known geometry subjected to rigid body motion and measurement of the lower limb of a human subject. The findings confirm that shape, motion, and full-field deformations and strains can be accurately measured, and demonstrate the feasibility of MultiDIC in multi-view in-vivo biomedical applications.},

@article{Zhang2000,
abstract = {We propose a flexible new technique to easily calibrate a camera. It is well suited for use without specialized knowledge of 3D geometry or computer vision. The technique only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique, and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthog- onal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one step from laboratory environments to real world use.},

@article{Heikkila1997,
abstract = {In geometrical camera calibration the objective is to determine a\nset of camera parameters that describe the mapping between 3-D reference\ncoordinates and 2-D image coordinates. Various methods for camera\ncalibration can be found from the literature. However surprisingly\nlittle attention has been paid to the whole calibration procedure, i.e.,\ncontrol point extraction from images, model fitting, image correction,\nand errors originating in these stages. The main interest has been in\nmodel fitting, although the other stages are also important. In this\npaper we present a four-step calibration procedure that is an extension\nto the two-step method. There is an additional step to compensate for\ndistortion caused by circular features, and a step for correcting the\ndistorted image coordinates. The image correction is performed with an\nempirical inverse model that accurately compensates for radial and\ntangential distortions. Finally, a linear method for solving the\nparameters of the inverse model is presented},

@article{Blaber2015,
abstract = {Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is an important and widely used non-contact technique for measuring material deformation. Considerable progress has been made in recent decades in both developing new experimental DIC techniques and in enhancing the performance of the relevant computational algorithms. Despite this progress, there is a distinct lack of a freely available, high-quality, flexible DIC software. This paper documents a new DIC software package Ncorr that is meant to fill that crucial gap. Ncorr is an open-source subset based 2D DIC package that amalgamates modern DIC algorithms proposed in the literature with additional enhancements. Several applications of Ncorr that both validate it and showcase its capabilities are discussed.},
